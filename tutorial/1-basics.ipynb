    "\n",
    "We split the dataset into 4 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training set (~75%)\n",
    "\n",
    "  For each image in training set, the annotation contains a lot of lines, while each lines contains some character instances.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Each character instance contains:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    - its underlying character,\n",
    "    - its bounding box (polygon),\n",
    "    - and 6 attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Only Chinese character instances are completely annotated, non-Chinese characters (e.g., ASCII characters) are partially annotated.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Some ignore regions are annotated, which contain character instances that cannot be recognized by human (e.g., too small, too fuzzy).\n",
    "\n",
    "  We will show the annotation format in [next sections](#Annotation-format).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Validation set (~5%)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Annotations in validation set is the same as that in training set.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The split between training set and validation set is only a recommendation. We make no restriction on how you split them. To enlarge training data, you MAY use TRAIN+VAL to train your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Testing set for classification (~10%)\n",
    "\n",
    "  For this testing set, we make images and annotated bounding boxes publicly available. Underlying character, attributes and ignored regions are not avaliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  To evaluate your results on testing set, please visit our evaluation server.\n",
